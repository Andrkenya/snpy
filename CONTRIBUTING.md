# Thanks for contributing!
:+1: First of all, thanks for contributing! The team is happy to help if you have any questions. Have a look to this contributing guide and also to the [FAQ section](https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/blob/master/doc/faq.md). :feet:
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Snappy, which is hosted by the [KNP Labs Organization](https://github.com/KnpLabs) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document opening a pull request. :shipit:

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the following [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Before adding issues

Please verify the problem is actually a snappy problem and not a **wkhtmltopdf problem**.

To do so, simply copy paste the command displayed in the error message in your command prompt.  
If the same error appears on the command line, then it's a wkhtmltopdf problem,
and you'll have more chance to resolve your issue [there](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues).
